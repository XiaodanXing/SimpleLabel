## About The Project
This is a tool for fast and easy image labeling. This tool is developed based on PyQt, and an executable file can be downloaded ![HERE (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o3FuPKaeleLK5xhYZeDUcAWcM979sriA/view?usp=sharing) and Baidu Pan. 

I developed this tool because I have tons of images to label for my two class classification AI model, and I felt tired of typing 0 or 1 for each image into the csv file. This tool helped me with my projects, and I hope you enjoy it too!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Step 1. Download and uncompress the RAR file.


### Step 2. Find the executable file in the folder, and click it.

### Step 3. Type the official name for each class
For example, for my project, 0 represents the class "normal control", and 1 represents the class "COVID". You can type in Chinese too : D.

### Step 4. Start labeling

Open your image directory, and start labeling by pressing "A" and "D". When you finished, the label will automatically be saved in a CSV file named label.csv.

If you want to save the CSV file half way during your labeling, always remember to press the "SAVE" button.
